3. When deploying the template, type in the API Key and URL in the corresponding fields.

This will create a Key Vault storing the API Key in the selected resource group. The Logic App will then retrieve the key to query the MCAS API usign the URL you have specified.
If you do not perform these tasks before the deployement, you can leave the default value of the ARM template and later modify the variables in the Logic App.
