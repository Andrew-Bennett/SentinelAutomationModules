Module Description

### Office 365 Out of Office

The Out Of Office module takes user entity data and determines if the user has an Out of Office message set on their Office 365 mailbox.

### Azure Sentinel Related Alerts

The Related Alerts module takes the incident entity data and determines if other alerts about those same entities exist in Azure Sentinel within a specified timeframe.

### Azure Sentinel User Entity Behavior Analytics

The UEBA module allows you to take user entity data and lookup those users in the BehaviorAnalytics table to identity activities performed by the user that deviate from their previous patterns of behavior.

### Azure Sentinel Watchlists

The Azure Sentinel Watchlists module allows you to compare entity data from an incident against a watchlist to determine if that entity is present.  This supports watchlists containing columns with UserPrincipalNames, IP Addresses, or CIDR address blocks.
